# Multiple Choice WebApp with the questions for the driving license test in Bolivia 

This app was adapted from [this quiz app](https://github.com/bonham000/react-quiz-app) and the [FreeCodeCamp](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/multiple-choice-questions) and provides a practice testing and development environment for Driving Test's theorical multiple-choice questions.

**[It's running live here for you to practice on.](http://fcc-quiz.surge.sh/)**

The purpose of these challenges is to study for my test tomorrow. Primary categories include:

- **Normas de Circulación**
- **Primeros Auxilios**
- **Mecánica básica**


---

The challenges all live in the `src/challenges` directory. Each category has a separate `JSON` file. To contribute a question, simply make a pull request with your challenge question(s) in the appropriate seed file. To run this project locally, fork it to your machine and run `npm install` followed by `npm start` at the root level. Now you can add new questions and see them locally.
